In the midst of the Napoleonic Wars in 1806, most people believe magic to have long since disappeared from England - until the reclusive Mr. Norrell reveals his powers and becomes an overnight celebrity. Another practicing magician then emerges: the young and daring Jonathan Strange. He becomes Norrell's pupil, and the two join forces in the war against France. But Strange is increasingly drawn to the wild, most perilous forms of magic, and he soon risks sacrificing his partnership with Norrell and everything else he holds dear. Susanna Clarke's brilliant first novel is an utterly compelling epic tale of nineteenth-century England and the two magicians who, first as teacher and pupil and then as rivals, emerge to change its history., 2004-01-01, 2004, Fantasy, fantasy, Genre, genre, 0, 309684, Fiction, fiction, Genre, genre, 0, 159604, Young Adult, young-adult, Genre, genre, 0, 57727, Adventure, adventure, Genre, genre, 0, 42210, Classics, classics, Genre, genre, 0, 35989, Science fiction, science-fiction, Genre, genre, 0, 35377, History, history, Genre, genre, 0, 21247, Literature, literature, Genre, genre, 0, 2806, Historical Fiction, historical-fiction, Genre, genre, 0, 2764, Magic, magic, Genre, genre, 0, 1898, Adventurous, adventurous, Mood, mood, 0, 145088, mysterious, mysterious, Mood, mood, 0, 142100, funny, funny, Mood, mood, 0, 55615, dark, dark, Mood, mood, 0, 32808, tense, tense, Mood, mood, 0, 25786, challenging, challenging, Mood, mood, 0, 21684, emotional, emotional, Mood, mood, 0, 18371, reflective, reflective, Mood, mood, 0, 11145, lighthearted, lighthearted, Mood, mood, 0, 9555, sad, sad, Mood, mood, 0, 8117, , Strong Character Development, strong-character-development, Tag, tag, 0, 108000, Diverse Characters, diverse-characters, Tag, tag, 0, 101528, Loveable Characters, loveable-characters, Tag, tag, 0, 94405, Character driven, character-driven-93bc26e1-5a51-45d4-854b-c94b6a16141a, Tag, tag, 0, 72296, Unloveable Characters, unloveable-characters, Tag, tag, 0, 64455, Weak Character Development, weak-character-development, Tag, tag, 0, 50280, Not Diverse Characters, not-diverse-characters, Tag, tag, 0, 45048, Plot driven, plot-driven, Tag, tag, 0, 13754, A mix driven, a-mix-driven, Tag, tag, 0, 13612, Magic, magic-67ff87e2-ccff-456b-8a03-081ee6f38294, Tag, tag, 0, 114, 1195, 509, 1185, 51, 865, 419, 3.9940334128878283, false, contributions, authors, 86621, Susanna Clarke, susanna-clarke, 32054, https://assets.hardcover.app/authors/86621/7284260-L.jpg, #bbbbbb, 150, 160, Silver, 18, book_series, series, 39599, Strange & Norrell, strange-norrell, 2, 1, 212183, 39599, 1, 1 , true, 5994554, 2025-01-22, false, 1, 212183, 14298, 1054942, 2025-01-22T09:58:21.92692+00:00, 1, 2025-01-22T09:58:21.926099, UserBook, 0, false, 0, false, false, editions, 1054942, Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, 9113012800, 9789113012803, 2004-09-08, 1006, 1, 838, 1061861, https://assets.hardcover.app/external_data/59342910/297877e178ee1ed56c8954c96a234c4e4f513255.jpeg, #d0d0d0, 99, 160, Silver, Paperback, First Tor Edition, languages, 1, English, en, reading_formats, Read, countries, United States of America, publishers, 185, Tor Books, tor-books, 1016, user_books, , books, 301403, the-iron-king-1955, The Iron King, 1350162, https://assets.hardcover.app/external_data/26719664/b557b754c32588c2e5537cfcfc14ce3f0cb3e758.jpeg, #524e4b, 319, 500, Gray, "The Iron King--Philip the Fair--is as cold and silent, as handsome and unblinking as a statue. He governs his realm with an iron hand, but he cannot rule his own family: his sons are weak and their wives adulterous; while his red-blooded daughter Isabella is unhappily married to an English king who prefers the company of men. A web of scandal, murder and intrigue is weaving itself around the Iron King; but his downfall will come from an unexpected quarter. Bent on the persecution of the rich and powerful Knights Templar, Philip sentences Grand Master Jacques Molay to be burned at the stake, thus drawing down upon himself a curse that will destroy his entire dynasty..."--P.

A dangerous, hallucinatory, ancient Africa, which becomes a fantasy world as well-realized as anything Tolkien made, with language as powerful as Angela Carter's. I cannot wait for the next installment' Neil Gaiman, author of American Gods In this stunning follow-up to his Man Booker-winning A Brief History of Seven Killings, Marlon James draws on myth, fantasy and history to imagine a wholly new world, in which a legendary Tracker is hired to find a missing child... Tracker is known far and wide for his skills as a hunter: "He has a nose," people say -- as well as the eye of a wolf. Engaged to find a mysterious boy who has disappeared three years before, Tracker breaks his own rule of always working alone when he finds himself part of a rag-tag group that comes together to search for the boy. Full of striking characters with secrets of their own, including a shape-shifting man-animal known as Leopard, a witch and the giant-sized Ogo, this unlikely band follow the lost boy's scent from one ancient city to another; into dense forests and across deep rivers, set upon by creatures intent on destroying them. As he struggles to survive, Tracker starts to wonder: Who, really, is this boy? Why has he been missing for so long? Why do so many people want to keep Tracker from finding him? And perhaps the most important questions of all: Who is telling the truth, and who is lying? Drawing from African history and mythology and his own rich imagination, Marlon James has written a novel unlike anything that's come before it: a saga of breath-taking adventure that's also an ambitious and involving read. Defying categorization and full of unforgettable characters, Black Leopard, Red Wolf is both surprising and profound as it explores the fundamentals of truth, the limits of power, and our need to understand them both.
