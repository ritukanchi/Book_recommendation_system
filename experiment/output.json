the Hugo-award winning, epic New York Times Bestseller and basis for the BBC miniseries, two men change England's history when they bring magic back into the world. In the midst of the Napoleonic Wars in 1806, most people believe magic to have long since disappeared from England - until the reclusive Mr. Norrell reveals his powers and becomes an overnight celebrity. Another practicing magician then emerges: the young and daring Jonathan Strange. He becomes Norrell's pupil, and the two join forces in the war against France. But Strange is increasingly drawn to the wild, most perilous forms of magic, and he soon risks sacrificing his partnership with Norrell and everything else he holds dear. Susanna Clarke's brilliant first novel is an utterly compelling epic tale of nineteenth-century England and the two magicians who, first as teacher and pupil and then as rivals, emerge to change its history.","releaseDate":"2004-01-01","releaseYear":2004,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"Fantasy","tagSlug":"fantasy","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":309684},{"tag":"Fiction","tagSlug":"fiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":159604},{"tag":"Young

Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission – and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish. Except that right now, he doesn’t know that. He can’t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it. All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he’s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.\n\nHis crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, he realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Alone on this tiny ship that’s been cobbled together by every government and space agency on the planet and hurled into the depths of space, it’s up to him to conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.\n\nAnd thanks to an unexpected ally, he just might have a chance.\n\nPart scientific mystery, part dazzling interstellar journey, Project Hail Mary is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to rival The Martian – while taking us to places it never dreamed of going.","releaseDate":"2021-01-01","releaseYear":2021,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"Science

A dangerous, hallucinatory, ancient Africa, which becomes a fantasy world as well-realized as anything Tolkien made, with language as powerful as Angela Carter's. I cannot wait for the next installment' Neil Gaiman, author of American Gods In this stunning follow-up to his Man Booker-winning A Brief History of Seven Killings, Marlon James draws on myth, fantasy and history to imagine a wholly new world, in which a legendary Tracker is hired to find a missing child... Tracker is known far and wide for his skills as a hunter: \"He has a nose,\" people say -- as well as the eye of a wolf. Engaged to find a mysterious boy who has disappeared three years before, Tracker breaks his own rule of always working alone when he finds himself part of a rag-tag group that comes together to search for the boy. Full of striking characters with secrets of their own, including a shape-shifting man-animal known as Leopard, a witch and the giant-sized Ogo, this unlikely band follow the lost boy's scent from one ancient city to another; into dense forests and across deep rivers, set upon by creatures intent on destroying them. As he struggles to survive, Tracker starts to wonder: Who, really, is this boy? Why has he been missing for so long? Why do so many people want to keep Tracker from finding him? And perhaps the most important questions of all: Who is telling the truth, and who is lying? Drawing from African history and mythology and his own rich imagination, Marlon James has written a novel unlike anything that's come before it: a saga of breath-taking adventure that's also an ambitious and involving read. Defying categorization and full of unforgettable characters, Black Leopard, Red Wolf is both surprising and profound as it explores the fundamentals of truth, the limits of power, and our need to understand them both. Black Leopard, Red Wolf is the first novel in Marlon James's Dark Star Trilogy.","releaseDate":"2019-02-05","releaseYear":2019,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"Fantasy","tagSlug":"fantasy","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":121444},{"tag":"Fiction","tagSlug":"fiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":65717},{"tag":"Adventure","tagSlug":"adventure","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":33499},{"tag":"Science fiction","tagSlug":"science-fiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":27158},{"tag":"LGBTQ","tagSlug":"lgbtq","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":25480},{"tag":"Mythology","tagSlug":"mythology-0fe49f8c-88c9-4454-9a3d-01b2b10edd39","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":92}],"Mood":[],"Content Warning":[],"Tag":[{"tag":"Africa","tagSlug":"africa","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":7}]},"usersCount":541,"usersReadCount":114,"journalsCount":536,"reviewsCount":21,"pages":612,"audioSeconds":null,"ratingsCount":84,"rating":3.1011904761904763,"compilation":false,"contributions":[{"__typename":"contributions","contribution":null,"author":{"__typename":"authors","id":123577,"name":"Marlon James","slug":"marlon-james","cachedImage":{"id":152730,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/books/123577/8203173-L.jpg","color":"#8c7f65","width":294,"height":500,"color_name":"Gray"},"booksCount":27}}],"bookSeries":[{"__typename":"book_series","series":{"__typename":"series","id":5600,"name":"The Dark Star Trilogy","slug":"the-dark-star-trilogy","booksCount":3,"primaryBooksCount":3,"isCompleted":null,"description":null},"bookId":432346,"seriesId":5600,"position":1,"details":"1","featured":false}]},"id":5994552,"dateAdded":"2025-01-22","owned":false,"rating":null,"lastReadDate":null,"firstReadDate":null,"statusId":1,"bookId":432346,"userId":14298,"editionId":30402602,"updatedAt":"2025-01-22T09:58:18.401994+00:00","privacySettingId":1,"reviewedAt":"2025-01-22T09:58:18.401315","url":null,"mediaUrl":null,"objectType":"UserBook","likesCount":0,"hasReview":false,"reviewSlate":{},"reviewLength":0,"reviewHasSpoilers":false,"sponsoredReview":false,"edition":{"__typename":"editions","id":30402602,"title":"Black Leopard, Red Wolf (The Dark Star Trilogy #1)","asin":null,"isbn10":"0735220174","isbn13":"9780735220171","releaseDate":"2019-02-05","releaseYear":null,"pages":612,"audioSeconds":null,"readingFormatId":1,"usersCount":150,"cachedImage":{"id":730808,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/edition/30402602/0b06ed5003aeb86468059aafa5cfb311abd7e4dc.jpeg","color":"#e1dede","width":329,"height":500,"color_name":"Silver"},"editionFormat":null,"editionInformation":null,"language":null,"readingFormat":{"__typename":"reading_formats","format":"Read"},"country":null,"publisher":null}},{"__typename":"user_books","user_book_reads":[],"book":{"__typename":"books","id":464906,"slug":"grokking-algorithms-2024","title":"Grokking Algorithms","cachedImage":{"id":665091,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/edition/30382579/content.jpeg","color":"#f1f1f1","width":128,"height":161,"color_name":"White"},"headline":null,"description":"A friendly, fully-illustrated introduction to the most important computer programming algorithms.

J. Fikry, two friends—often in love, but never lovers—come together as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately, a kind of immortality.\n\nOn a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn’t heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, Ichigo. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won’t protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts. Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin’s Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before.\n\n \"Utterly brilliant. In this sweeping, gorgeously written novel, Gabrielle Zevin charts the beauty, tenacity, and fragility of human love and creativity.

lies. Dark humor. Deadly consequences… Bestselling sensation Juniper Song is not who she says she is, she didn’t write the book she claims she wrote, and she is most certainly not Asian American—in this chilling and hilariously cutting novel from R.F. Kuang, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Babel.","description":"Authors June Hayward and Athena Liu were supposed to be twin rising stars. But Athena’s a literary darling. June Hayward is literally nobody. Who wants stories about basic white girls, June thinks.\n\nSo when June witnesses Athena’s death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse: she steals Athena’s just-finished masterpiece, an experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers during World War I.\n\nSo what if June edits Athena’s novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song—complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesn’t this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? That’s what June claims, and the New York Times bestseller list seems to agree.\n\nBut June can’t get away from Athena’s shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring June’s (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves.\n\nWith its totally immersive first-person voice, Yellowface grapples with questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation, as well as the terrifying alienation of social media. R.F. Kuang’s novel is timely, razor-sharp, and eminently readable.","releaseDate":"2023-01-01","releaseYear":2023,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"Fiction","tagSlug":"fiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0.16666666666666666,"count":467526},{"tag":"Mystery","tagSlug":"mystery","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":7103},{"tag":"Thriller","tagSlug":"thriller","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":5970},{"tag":"Contemporary","tagSlug":"contemporary-5aa3bf50-fe7e-496f-835d-8659c4fe219b","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":762},{"tag":"Technology

A fantasy like you've never read before.\" ―#1 New York Times bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout\n\nEnter the brutal and elite world of a war college for dragon riders from #1 New York Times bestselling author Rebecca Yarros\n\nTwenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. Now, the commanding general―also known as her tough-as-talons mother―has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders.\n\nBut when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them.\n\nWith fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s daughter―like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant.\n\nShe’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.\n\nYet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom's protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.\n\nFriends, enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an agenda―because once you enter, there are only two ways out: graduate or die.","releaseDate":"2023-01-01","releaseYear":2023,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"Fantasy","tagSlug":"fantasy","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":1325456},{"tag":"Fiction","tagSlug":"fiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0.14285714285714285,"count":561239},{"tag":"Young

It's not just that it's grueling and maliciously brutal, or even that it's designed to stretch the riders' capacity for pain beyond endurance. It's the new vice commandant, who's made it his personal mission to teach Violet exactly how powerless she is - unless she betrays the man she loves.\n\nAlthough Violet's body might be weaker and frailer than everyone else's, she still has her wits, and a will of iron. And leadership is forgetting the most important lesson Basgiath has taught her: Dragon riders make their own rules.\n\nBut a determination to survive won't be enough this year.\n\nBecause Violet knows the real secret hidden for centuries at Basgiath War College - and nothing, not even dragon fire, may be enough to save them in the

faerie folklore—she just wrote the world’s first comprehensive of encylopaedia of faeries. She’s learned many of the secrets of the Hidden Folk on her adventures . . . and also from her fellow scholar and former rival, Wendell Bambleby. \n\nBecause Bambleby is more than infuriatingly charming. He’s an exiled faerie king on the run from his murderous mother, and in search of a door back to his realm. So despite Emily’s feelings for Bambleby, she’s not ready to accept his proposal of marriage: Loving one of the Fair Folk comes with secrets and danger. And she also has a new project to focus on: a map of the realms of faerie. \n\nWhile she is preparing her research, Bambleby lands her in trouble yet again, when assassins sent by Bambleby’s mother invade Cambridge. Now Bambleby and Emily are on another adventure, this time to the picturesque Austrian Alps, where Emily believes they may find the door to Bambley’s realm, and the key to freeing him from his family’s dark plans. But with new relationships for the prickly Emily to navigate and dangerous Folk lurking in every forest and hollow, Emily must unravel the mysterious workings of faerie doors, and of her own heart.","releaseDate":"2024-01-01","releaseYear":2024,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"Fantasy","tagSlug":"fantasy","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":308308},{"tag":"Fiction","tagSlug":"fiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":79583},{"tag":"Young

Holmes and Watson–style detective duo take the stage in this fantasy with a mystery twist, from the Edgar-winning, multiple Hugo-nominated Robert Jackson Bennett\n\n“Superbly blends mystery and fantasy . . . Give me more of this world and these characters ASAP!”—#1 New York Times bestselling author Meg Gardiner\n\nIn Daretana’s greatest mansion, a high imperial officer lies dead—killed, to all appearances, when a tree erupted from his body. Even here at the Empire’s borders, where contagions abound and the blood of the leviathans works strange magical changes, it’s a death both terrifying and impossible.\n\nAssigned to investigate is Ana Dolabra, a detective whose reputation for brilliance is matched only by her eccentricities. Rumor has it that she wears a blindfold at all times, and that she can solve impossible cases without even stepping outside the walls of her home.\n\nAt her side is her new assistant, Dinios Kol, magically altered in ways that make him the perfect aide to Ana’s brilliance. Din is at turns scandalized, perplexed, and utterly infuriated by his new superior—but as the case unfolds and he watches Ana’s mind leap from one startling deduction to the next, he must admit that she is, indeed, the Empire’s greatest detective.\n\nAs the two close in on a mastermind and uncover a scheme that threatens the Empire itself, Din realizes he’s barely begun to assemble the puzzle that is Ana Dolabra—and wonders how long he’ll be able to keep his own secrets safe from her piercing intellect.\n\nBy an “endlessly inventive” (Vulture) author with a “wicked sense of humor” (NPR), The Tainted Cup mixes the charms of detective fiction with brilliant world-building to deliver a fiendishly clever mystery that’s at once instantly recognizable and thrillingly new.\n","releaseDate":"2024-01-01","releaseYear":2024,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"Fantasy","tagSlug":"fantasy","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":535857},{"tag":"Fiction","tagSlug":"fiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":158236},{"tag":"Science

dangerous alliance between a Vampyre bride and an Alpha Werewolf becomes a love deep enough to sink your teeth into in this new paranormal romance from the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Love, Theoretically and The Love Hypothesis.\n\nMisery Lark, the only daughter of the most powerful Vampyre councilman of the Southwest, is an outcast—again. Her days of living in anonymity among the Humans are over: she has been called upon to uphold a historic peacekeeping alliance between the Vampyres and their mortal enemies, the Weres, and she sees little choice but to surrender herself in the exchange—again…\n\nWeres are ruthless and unpredictable, and their Alpha, Lowe Moreland, is no exception. He rules his pack with absolute authority, but not without justice. And, unlike the Vampyre Council, not without feeling. It’s clear from the way he tracks Misery’s every movement that he doesn’t trust her. If only he knew how right he was….\n\nBecause Misery has her own reasons to agree to this marriage of convenience, reasons that have nothing to do with politics or alliances, and everything to do with the only thing she’s ever cared about. And she is willing to do whatever it takes to get back what’s hers, even if it means a life alone in Were territory…alone with the wolf.\n\n","releaseDate":"2024-01-01","releaseYear":2024,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"Fiction","tagSlug":"fiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":160354},{"tag":"Fantasy","tagSlug":"fantasy","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":155936},{"tag":"Young

But in 1965, the world is changing, and she suddenly dares to imagine a different future for herself. When her brother ships out to serve in Vietnam, she joins the Army Nurse Corps and follows his path.\n\nAs green and inexperienced as the men sent to Vietnam to fight, Frankie is overwhelmed by the chaos and destruction of war. Each day is a gamble of life and death, hope and betrayal; friendships run deep and can be shattered in an instant. In war, she meets—and becomes one of—the lucky, the brave, the broken, and the lost.\n\nBut war is just the beginning for Frankie and her veteran friends. The real battle lies in coming home to a changed and divided America, to angry protesters, and to a country that wants to forget Vietnam.\n\nThe Women is the story of one woman gone to war, but it shines a light on all women who put themselves in harm’s way and whose sacrifice and commitment to their country has too often been forgotten. A novel about deep friendships and bold patriotism, The Women is a richly drawn story with a memorable heroine whose idealism and courage under fire will come to define an era.","releaseDate":"2024-01-01","releaseYear":2024,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"Fiction","tagSlug":"fiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":390865},{"tag":"War","tagSlug":"war","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":16344},{"tag":"Historical

has a curse, and thanks to a Reddit thread, it's now all over the internet. Every woman he dates goes on to find their soul mate the second they break up. When a woman slides into his DMs with the same problem, they come up with a plan: They'll date each other and break up. Their curses will cancel each other’s out, and they’ll both go on to find the love of their lives. It’s a bonkers idea… and it just might work. \n\nEmma hadn't planned that her next assignment as a traveling nurse would be in Minnesota, but she and her best friend agree that dating Justin is too good of an opportunity to pass up, especially when they get to rent an adorable cottage on a private island on Lake Minnetonka.\n\nIt's supposed to be a quick fling, just for the summer. But when Emma's toxic mother shows up and Justin has to assume guardianship of his three siblings, they're suddenly navigating a lot more than they expected--including catching real feelings for each other. What if this time Fate has actually brought the perfect pair

Do Fewer Things. Work at a Natural Pace. Obsess over Quality. ~ \nFrom the New York Times bestselling author of Digital Minimalism and Deep Work, a groundbreaking philosophy for pursuing meaningful accomplishment while avoiding overload \nOur current definition of “productivity” is broken. It pushes us to treat busyness as a proxy for useful effort, leading to impossibly lengthy task lists and ceaseless meetings. We’re overwhelmed by all we have to do and on the edge of burnout, left to decide between giving into soul-sapping hustle culture or rejecting ambition altogether. But are these really our only choices? \nLong before the arrival of pinging inboxes and clogged schedules, history’s most creative and impactful philosophers, scientists, artists, and writers mastered the art of producing valuable work with staying power. In this timely and provocative book, Cal Newport harnesses the wisdom of these traditional knowledge workers to radically transform our modern jobs. Drawing from deep research on the habits and mindsets of a varied cast of storied thinkers – from Galileo and Isaac Newton, to Jane Austen and Georgia O’Keefe – Newport lays out the key principles of “slow productivity,” a more sustainable alternative to the aimless overwhelm that defines our current moment. Combining cultural criticism with systematic pragmatism, Newport deconstructs the absurdities inherent in standard notions of productivity, and then provides step-by-step advice for workers to replace them with a slower, more humane alternative. \nFrom the aggressive rethinking of workload management, to introducing seasonal variation, to shifting your performance toward long-term quality, Slow Productivity provides a roadmap for escaping overload and arriving instead at a more timeless approach to pursuing meaningful accomplishment. The world of work is due for a new revolution. Slow productivity is exactly what we need.","releaseDate":"2024-01-01","releaseYear":2024,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"Nonfiction","tagSlug":"nonfiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":8373},{"tag":"Business & Economics","tagSlug":"business-economics","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":4091},{"tag":"Psychology","tagSlug":"psychology","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":2996},{"tag":"Self-Help","tagSlug":"self-help-e026dece-d926-4e01-9480-a316b3be0396","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":1386}],"Mood":[{"tag":"reflective","tagSlug":"reflective","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":33432},{"tag":"informative","tagSlug":"informative","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":16023},{"tag":"inspiring","tagSlug":"inspiring","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":10626},{"tag":"lighthearted","tagSlug":"lighthearted","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":9548},{"tag":"hopeful","tagSlug":"hopeful","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":7306}],"Content Warning":[],"Tag":[]},"usersCount":267,"usersReadCount":92,"journalsCount":213,"reviewsCount":9,"pages":256,"audioSeconds":null,"ratingsCount":57,"rating":3.763157894736842,"compilation":false,"contributions":[{"__typename":"contributions","contribution":null,"author":{"__typename":"authors","id":213137,"name":"Cal Newport","slug":"cal-newport","cachedImage":{"id":35170,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/authors/213137/10668629-L.jpg","color":"#ad4e27","width":416,"height":500,"color_name":"Brown"},"booksCount":40}}],"bookSeries":[]},"id":6011369,"dateAdded":"2025-01-24","owned":false,"rating":null,"lastReadDate":null,"firstReadDate":null,"statusId":1,"bookId":898371,"userId":14298,"editionId":30920165,"updatedAt":"2025-01-24T15:29:20.243359+00:00","privacySettingId":1,"reviewedAt":"2025-01-24T15:29:20.242724","url":null,"mediaUrl":null,"objectType":"UserBook","likesCount":0,"hasReview":false,"reviewSlate":{},"reviewLength":0,"reviewHasSpoilers":false,"sponsoredReview":false,"edition":{"__typename":"editions","id":30920165,"title":"Slow Productivity: The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout","asin":null,"isbn10":"0593544854","isbn13":"9780593544853","releaseDate":"2024-03-05","releaseYear":null,"pages":256,"audioSeconds":null,"readingFormatId":1,"usersCount":60,"cachedImage":{"id":2334426,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/external_data/60702703/983bb1e60d94ccec2e4f80c90715b93ffaccdc04.jpeg","color":"#7d6469","width":331,"height":500,"color_name":"Purple"},"editionFormat":"","editionInformation":"","language":{"__typename":"languages","id":1,"language":"English","code":"en"},"readingFormat":{"__typename":"reading_formats","format":"Read"},"country":{"__typename":"countries","name":"Colombia"},"publisher":{"__typename":"publishers","id":1,"name":"Penguin","slug":"penguin","editionsCount":5389}}},{"__typename":"user_books","user_book_reads":[],"book":{"__typename":"books","id":965305,"slug":"the-dead-cat-tail-assassins","title":"The Dead Cat Tail Assassins","cachedImage":{"id":1666103,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/editions/31155264/2285422257882972-127305606.jpg","color":"#b8a582","width":1500,"height":2400,"color_name":"Gray"},"headline":null,"description":"The Dead Cat Tail Assassins are not cats.\n\nNor do they have tails.\n\nBut they are most assuredly dead.\n\nNebula and Alex Award winner P.

November 6, 1860, Abraham Lincoln became the fluky victor in a tight race for president. The country was bitterly at odds; Southern extremists were moving ever closer to destroying the Union, with one state after another seceding and Lincoln powerless to stop them. Slavery fueled the conflict, but somehow the passions of North and South came to focus on a lonely federal fortress in Charleston Harbor: Fort Sumter.\n\nMaster storyteller Erik Larson offers a gripping account of the chaotic months between Lincoln’s election and the Confederacy’s shelling of Sumter—a period marked by tragic errors and miscommunications, enflamed egos and craven ambitions, personal tragedies and betrayals. Lincoln himself wrote that the trials of these five months were “so great that, could I have anticipated them, I would not have believed it possible to survive them.”\n\nAt the heart of this suspense-filled narrative are Major Robert Anderson, Sumter’s commander and a former slave owner sympathetic to the South but loyal to the Union; Edmund Ruffin, a vain and bloodthirsty radical who stirs secessionist ardor at every opportunity; and Mary Boykin Chesnut, wife of a prominent planter, conflicted over both marriage and slavery and seeing parallels between them. In the middle of it all is the overwhelmed Lincoln, battling with his duplicitous secretary of state, William Seward, as he tries desperately to avert a war that he fears is inevitable—one that will eventually kill 750,000 Americans.\n\nDrawing on diaries, secret communiques, slave ledgers, and plantation records, Larson gives us a political horror story that captures the forces that led America to the brink—a dark reminder that we often don’t see a cataclysm coming until it’s too late.","releaseDate":"2024-04-30","releaseYear":2024,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"History","tagSlug":"history","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":41072},{"tag":"War","tagSlug":"war","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":16248},{"tag":"Nonfiction","tagSlug":"nonfiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":8332}],"Mood":[{"tag":"tense","tagSlug":"tense","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":12607},{"tag":"informative","tagSlug":"informative","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":10470}],"Content Warning":[],"Tag":[{"tag":"non-fiction","tagSlug":"non-fiction","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":24}]},"usersCount":146,"usersReadCount":27,"journalsCount":143,"reviewsCount":2,"pages":593,"audioSeconds":null,"ratingsCount":23,"rating":4.108695652173913,"compilation":false,"contributions":[{"__typename":"contributions","contribution":null,"author":{"__typename":"authors","id":65357,"name":"Erik Larson","slug":"erik-larson-6bc0a2ff-5cee-4094-a0af-c6aa8c3dd8cd","cachedImage":{"id":33597,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/authors/147646/7405144-L.jpg","color":"#6b4026","width":171,"height":266,"color_name":"Brown"},"booksCount":43}}],"bookSeries":[]},"id":6011380,"dateAdded":"2025-01-24","owned":false,"rating":null,"lastReadDate":null,"firstReadDate":null,"statusId":1,"bookId":1078963,"userId":14298,"editionId":31103019,"updatedAt":"2025-01-24T15:30:05.893706+00:00","privacySettingId":1,"reviewedAt":"2025-01-24T15:30:05.893038","url":null,"mediaUrl":null,"objectType":"UserBook","likesCount":0,"hasReview":false,"reviewSlate":{},"reviewLength":0,"reviewHasSpoilers":false,"sponsoredReview":false,"edition":{"__typename":"editions","id":31103019,"title":"The Demon of Unrest: A Saga of Hubris, Heartbreak, and Heroism at the Dawn of the Civil War","asin":null,"isbn10":"0385348746","isbn13":"9780385348744","releaseDate":"2024-04-30","releaseYear":null,"pages":null,"audioSeconds":null,"readingFormatId":1,"usersCount":14,"cachedImage":{"id":1609879,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/external_data/60251901/7ba0ee932e497f8957c3277891d52b09b472796f.jpeg","color":"#47291b","width":98,"height":148,"color_name":"Black"},"editionFormat":"","editionInformation":"","language":null,"readingFormat":{"__typename":"reading_formats","format":"Read"},"country":{"__typename":"countries","name":"United States of America"},"publisher":null}},{"__typename":"user_books","user_book_reads":[{"__typename":"user_book_reads","id":2316172,"userBookId":6011378,"startedAt":"2025-01-24","finishedAt":null,"editionId":31107967,"progress":null,"progressPages":null,"progressSeconds":null,"edition":{"__typename":"editions","id":31107967,"title":"The Husbands","asin":null,"isbn10":"0385550618","isbn13":"9780385550611","releaseDate":"2024-04-02","releaseYear":null,"pages":352,"audioSeconds":null,"readingFormatId":1,"usersCount":16,"cachedImage":{"id":1616918,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/external_data/60256349/f127c6c7aaa0a42ab83fa95fc0812122e7986929.jpeg","color":"#f8d4ad","width":98,"height":148,"color_name":"Beige"},"editionFormat":"","editionInformation":"","language":null,"readingFormat":{"__typename":"reading_formats","format":"Read"},"country":{"__typename":"countries","name":"United States of America"},"publisher":null}}],"book":{"__typename":"books","id":1083931,"slug":"the-husbands-2024","title":"The Husbands","cachedImage":{"id":1616918,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/external_data/60256349/f127c6c7aaa0a42ab83fa95fc0812122e7986929.jpeg","color":"#f8d4ad","width":98,"height":148,"color_name":"Beige"},"headline":null,"description":"INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • READ WITH JENNA’S APRIL BOOK CLUB PICK • The Husbands delights in asking: how do we navigate life, love, and choice in a world of never-ending options?

There’s only one problem—she’s not married. She’s never seen this man before in her life. But according to her friends, her much-improved decor, and the photos on her phone, they’ve been together for years.\n\nAs Lauren tries to puzzle out how she could be married to someone she can’t remember meeting, Michael goes to the attic to change a lightbulb and abruptly disappears. In his place, a new man emerges, and a new, slightly altered life re-forms around her. Realizing that her attic is creating an infinite supply of husbands, Lauren confronts the question: If swapping lives is as easy as changing a lightbulb, how do you know you’ve taken the right path?

Fleeing my father's cruelty, the wicked king who robbed me of a future, I face death in the streets, caught between a rebellion and a tyrant's reign. Captured by those sworn to kill me, the rebels remain blind to my true identity-the missing daughter of the despised king. Faced with an impossible choice, I stand before them: join the rebels or face their blades. Yet, Dacre, the son of the ruthless rebellion commander, becomes torn between suspicion and a desire that mirrors my own. He allows no one to touch me, tries to protect me, yet threatens me at every turn. As secrets are weaved beyond our hidden realm, a fierce battle unfolds within me. As I get closer to the rebels, and their cause, my loyalty to my kingdom clashes with my undeniable devotion to Dacre and the burning connection between us. In a world where love and hate are two edges of the same blade, I find myself caught in a delicate dance between forbidden desire and my looming destiny.","releaseDate":"2024-03-19","releaseYear":2024,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"Fiction","tagSlug":"fiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":76600},{"tag":"Fantasy","tagSlug":"fantasy","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":73418}],"Mood":[{"tag":"Adventurous","tagSlug":"adventurous","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":17802},{"tag":"mysterious","tagSlug":"mysterious","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":13901},{"tag":"tense","tagSlug":"tense","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":12532}],"Content Warning":[],"Tag":[{"tag":"Loveable Characters","tagSlug":"loveable-characters","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":18456},{"tag":"Not Diverse Characters","tagSlug":"not-diverse-characters","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":14492},{"tag":"Weak Character Development","tagSlug":"weak-character-development","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":12118},{"tag":"Character driven","tagSlug":"character-driven-93bc26e1-5a51-45d4-854b-c94b6a16141a","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":10097}]},"usersCount":91,"usersReadCount":19,"journalsCount":90,"reviewsCount":4,"pages":343,"audioSeconds":null,"ratingsCount":12,"rating":3.375,"compilation":false,"contributions":[{"__typename":"contributions","contribution":null,"author":{"__typename":"authors","id":294051,"name":"Holly Renee","slug":"holly-renee","cachedImage":{"id":319442,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/books/294051/8658809-L.jpg","color":"#fefefe","width":324,"height":500,"color_name":"White"},"booksCount":16}}],"bookSeries":[{"__typename":"book_series","series":{"__typename":"series","id":82895,"name":"The Veiled Kingdom","slug":"the-veiled-kingdom","booksCount":2,"primaryBooksCount":2,"isCompleted":null,"description":null},"bookId":1172401,"seriesId":82895,"position":1,"details":"1","featured":true}]},"id":6011373,"dateAdded":"2025-01-24","owned":false,"rating":null,"lastReadDate":null,"firstReadDate":null,"statusId":1,"bookId":1172401,"userId":14298,"editionId":31196840,"updatedAt":"2025-01-24T15:29:36.387245+00:00","privacySettingId":1,"reviewedAt":"2025-01-24T15:29:36.386516","url":null,"mediaUrl":null,"objectType":"UserBook","likesCount":0,"hasReview":false,"reviewSlate":{},"reviewLength":0,"reviewHasSpoilers":false,"sponsoredReview":false,"edition":{"__typename":"editions","id":31196840,"title":"The Veiled Kingdom","asin":null,"isbn10":"1957514469","isbn13":"9781957514468","releaseDate":"2024-03-19","releaseYear":null,"pages":343,"audioSeconds":null,"readingFormatId":1,"usersCount":54,"cachedImage":{"id":2816994,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/editions/31196840/4929370874148316.jpeg","color":"#603d4c","width":1290,"height":1901,"color_name":"Purple"},"editionFormat":"Paperback","editionInformation":"","language":{"__typename":"languages","id":1,"language":"English","code":"en"},"readingFormat":{"__typename":"reading_formats","format":"Read"},"country":{"__typename":"countries","name":"United States of America"},"publisher":null}},{"__typename":"user_books","user_book_reads":[],"book":{"__typename":"books","id":1180354,"slug":"home-is-where-the-bodies-are-2024","title":"Home Is Where the Bodies Are","cachedImage":{"id":3308808,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/editions/31205033/5952029087026423.jpg","color":"#d26e53","width":1300,"height":2080,"color_name":"Orange"},"headline":null,"description":"After their mother passes, three estranged siblings reunite to sort out her estate.\n\nBeth, the oldest, never left home.

Beth, Nicole, and Michael must now decide whether to leave the past in the past or uncover the dark secret their mother took to her grave.","releaseDate":"2024-04-30","releaseYear":2024,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"Fiction","tagSlug":"fiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":79681},{"tag":"Mystery","tagSlug":"mystery","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":7299},{"tag":"Thriller","tagSlug":"thriller","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":6120}],"Mood":[{"tag":"mysterious","tagSlug":"mysterious","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":99470},{"tag":"emotional","tagSlug":"emotional","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":73484},{"tag":"dark","tagSlug":"dark","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":65616},{"tag":"tense","tagSlug":"tense","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":64465},{"tag":"funny","tagSlug":"funny","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":11123},{"tag":"sad","tagSlug":"sad","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":8117},{"tag":"challenging","tagSlug":"challenging","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":7228},{"tag":"suspenseful","tagSlug":"suspenseful","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":137}],"Content Warning":[],"Tag":[{"tag":"Unloveable Characters","tagSlug":"unloveable-characters","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":64455},{"tag":"Not Diverse Characters","tagSlug":"not-diverse-characters","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":60064},{"tag":"A mix driven","tagSlug":"a-mix-driven","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":40836},{"tag":"Weak Character Development","tagSlug":"weak-character-development","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":37710},{"tag":"Strong Character Development","tagSlug":"strong-character-development","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":36000},{"tag":"Loveable Characters","tagSlug":"loveable-characters","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":18881},{"tag":"Plot driven","tagSlug":"plot-driven","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":13754},{"tag":"Female MC","tagSlug":"female-mc","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":73}]},"usersCount":295,"usersReadCount":92,"journalsCount":287,"reviewsCount":17,"pages":249,"audioSeconds":null,"ratingsCount":76,"rating":3.375,"compilation":false,"contributions":[{"__typename":"contributions","contribution":null,"author":{"__typename":"authors","id":297855,"name":"Jeneva Rose","slug":"jeneva-rose","cachedImage":{"id":1717324,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/author/297855/8072595637859448.jpg","color":"#a76d53","width":1000,"height":1500,"color_name":"Gray"},"booksCount":8}}],"bookSeries":[]},"id":6011376,"dateAdded":"2025-01-24","owned":false,"rating":null,"lastReadDate":null,"firstReadDate":null,"statusId":1,"bookId":1180354,"userId":14298,"editionId":31205033,"updatedAt":"2025-01-24T15:29:51.822072+00:00","privacySettingId":1,"reviewedAt":"2025-01-24T15:29:51.821485","url":null,"mediaUrl":null,"objectType":"UserBook","likesCount":0,"hasReview":false,"reviewSlate":{},"reviewLength":0,"reviewHasSpoilers":false,"sponsoredReview":false,"edition":{"__typename":"editions","id":31205033,"title":"Home Is Where the Bodies Are","asin":"B0CCK3XKYK","isbn10":null,"isbn13":"9798212911221","releaseDate":"2024-04-30","releaseYear":null,"pages":249,"audioSeconds":null,"readingFormatId":1,"usersCount":138,"cachedImage":{"id":3308808,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/editions/31205033/5952029087026423.jpg","color":"#d26e53","width":1300,"height":2080,"color_name":"Orange"},"editionFormat":"Hardcover","editionInformation":"","language":{"__typename":"languages","id":1,"language":"English","code":"en"},"readingFormat":{"__typename":"reading_formats","format":"Read"},"country":{"__typename":"countries","name":"United States of America"},"publisher":{"__typename":"publishers","id":641,"name":"Blackstone Publishing","slug":"blackstone-publishing","editionsCount":247}}},{"__typename":"user_books","user_book_reads":[],"book":{"__typename":"books","id":1180764,"slug":"wild-love-2024","title":"Wild Love","cachedImage":{"id":1718081,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/external_data/60342123/1248c59f922e36c2e0a440cd3151d2254e3cf1d4.jpeg","color":"#c19d9b","width":128,"height":201,"color_name":"Silver"},"headline":null,"description":"She's been driving him wild for years.\n\nThe good kind of wild. The bad kind of wild.\n\nBut mostly, the kind of wild that comes with wanting your best friend's little sister and knowing you can't have her.\n\nForbes may have labeled Ford Grant the World's Hottest Billionaire, but all he cares about is escaping the press and opening a recording studio in gorgeous small town Rose Hill. Something that comes to a screeching halt when he ends up face-to-face with a young girl who claims he's her biological father. Now, he spends his days balancing business with parenting a sullen twelve-year-old, all while trying desperately to keep his hands the hell off his best friend's sister, Rosie Belmont.\n\nAfter living in the city, Rosie came blasting back into town like a storm. Beautiful, messy, and chaotic. And one wide-eyed, desperate plea for a job is all it takes for Ford to hire her. He vows to keep her at arm's length. Tries to stick to scowls and grumpy one-liners. But with her, verbal sparring is a type of foreplay―friction that soon turns to blistering heat.\n\nFord knows damn well he shouldn't cross this line. But shouldn't and can't are two very different things.\n\nAnd the only thing he truly can't do is resist her.","releaseDate":"2024-04-09","releaseYear":2024,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"Fiction","tagSlug":"fiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":78709},{"tag":"Romance","tagSlug":"romance","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":10746},{"tag":"Contemporary","tagSlug":"contemporary-5aa3bf50-fe7e-496f-835d-8659c4fe219b","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":254},{"tag":"Contemporary

New York Times–bestselling author of The First Bad Man returns with an irreverently sexy, tender, hilarious, and surprising novel about a woman upending her life\n\nA semifamous artist announces her plan to drive cross-country, from LA to New York. Twenty minutes after leaving her husband and child at home, she spontaneously exits the freeway, beds down in a nondescript motel, and immerses herself in a temporary reinvention that turns out to be the start of an entirely different journey.\n\nMiranda July’s second novel confirms the brilliance of her unique approach to fiction. With July’s wry voice, perfect comic timing, unabashed curiosity about human intimacy, and palpable delight in pushing boundaries, All Fours tells the story of one woman’s quest for a new kind of freedom. Part absurd entertainment, part tender reinvention of the sexual, romantic, and domestic life of a forty-five-year-old female artist, All Fours transcends expectation while excavating our beliefs about life lived as a woman. Once again, July hijacks the familiar and turns it into something new and thrillingly, profoundly alive.","releaseDate":"2024-04-14","releaseYear":2024,"tags":{"Genre":[{"tag":"Fiction","tagSlug":"fiction","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":156356},{"tag":"LGBTQ","tagSlug":"lgbtq","category":"Genre","categorySlug":"genre","spoilerRatio":0,"count":15324}],"Mood":[{"tag":"emotional","tagSlug":"emotional","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":18284},{"tag":"reflective","tagSlug":"reflective","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":11077},{"tag":"funny","tagSlug":"funny","category":"Mood","categorySlug":"mood","spoilerRatio":0,"count":11063}],"Content Warning":[],"Tag":[{"tag":"Strong Character Development","tagSlug":"strong-character-development","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":17959},{"tag":"Not Diverse Characters","tagSlug":"not-diverse-characters","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":14994},{"tag":"Unloveable Characters","tagSlug":"unloveable-characters","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":12872},{"tag":"Character driven","tagSlug":"character-driven-93bc26e1-5a51-45d4-854b-c94b6a16141a","category":"Tag","categorySlug":"tag","spoilerRatio":0,"count":10308}]},"usersCount":174,"usersReadCount":67,"journalsCount":158,"reviewsCount":3,"pages":337,"audioSeconds":null,"ratingsCount":45,"rating":3.922222222222222,"compilation":false,"contributions":[{"__typename":"contributions","contribution":null,"author":{"__typename":"authors","id":191361,"name":"Miranda July","slug":"miranda-july","cachedImage":{"id":218354,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/books/191361/256045-L.jpg","color":"#e16b27","width":332,"height":500,"color_name":"Orange"},"booksCount":23}}],"bookSeries":[]},"id":6011377,"dateAdded":"2025-01-24","owned":false,"rating":null,"lastReadDate":null,"firstReadDate":null,"statusId":1,"bookId":1217638,"userId":14298,"editionId":31242709,"updatedAt":"2025-01-24T15:29:56.863763+00:00","privacySettingId":1,"reviewedAt":"2025-01-24T15:29:56.863102","url":null,"mediaUrl":null,"objectType":"UserBook","likesCount":0,"hasReview":false,"reviewSlate":{},"reviewLength":0,"reviewHasSpoilers":false,"sponsoredReview":false,"edition":{"__typename":"editions","id":31242709,"title":"All Fours","asin":null,"isbn10":"0593190262","isbn13":"9780593190265","releaseDate":"2024-05-14","releaseYear":null,"pages":337,"audioSeconds":null,"readingFormatId":1,"usersCount":122,"cachedImage":{"id":4226358,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/edition/31242709/bf062459e46e10e5f67665740fc7a5dddc7e115a.jpeg","color":"#eae8d9","width":331,"height":500,"color_name":"Beige"},"editionFormat":"Hardcover","editionInformation":"First edition","language":{"__typename":"languages","id":1,"language":"English","code":"en"},"readingFormat":{"__typename":"reading_formats","format":"Read"},"country":{"__typename":"countries","name":"United States of America"},"publisher":{"__typename":"publishers","id":650,"name":"Riverhead Books","slug":"riverhead-books","editionsCount":103}}}],"lists":[{"__typename":"lists","list_books":[],"id":81152,"objectType":"List","name":"Owned","userId":14298,"slug":"owned","ranked":false,"description":"Any editions of books you've marked as 'owned' will show up in this list.","url":null,"privacySettingId":1,"booksCount":0,"likesCount":0,"featuredProfile":false,"defaultView":"card","createdAt":"2024-06-29T08:51:59.317107","updatedAt":"2024-06-29T08:51:59.333637+00:00"}],"id":14298,"cachedImage":{"id":1231217,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/images/people/profilePics/profilePic3.svg","color":"#ffffff","width":201,"height":201,"color_name":"White"},"name":"Ritu Kanchi","username":"ritukanchi","flair":null,"membership":null,"statusId":2,"bio":null,"birthdate":"2004-01-11","location":"Bengaluru","link":null,"followersCount":1,"followedUsersCount":2,"accountPrivacySettingId":1,"createdAt":"2024-06-29T08:51:59.28002+00:00","pronounPersonal":"she","pronounPossessive":"her","booksCount":0,"librarianRoles":["appender"],"cachedGenres":[],"onboarded":true,"pro":false}]}
